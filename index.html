        <p id="tribute-info " class="para "> Sappho was an Archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by music. In ancient times, Sappho was widely regarded as one of the greatest lyric poets and was given names
            such as the "Tenth Muse " and "The Poetess ". Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has mostly survived in fragmentary form; only the "Ode to Aphrodite " is certainly complete. As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators
            claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho's style. Little is known of Sappho's life She was from a wealthy family from Lesbos,
            though her parents' names are uncertain. Ancient sources say that she had three brothers; Charaxos, Larichos and Eurygios. Two of them, Charaxos and Larichos, are also mentioned in the Brothers Poem discovered in 2014. She was exiled to Sicily
            around 600 BCE, and may have continued to work until around 570 BCE. Later legends surrounding Sappho's love fo her death are unreliable.</p>
        <h4 id="title " class="title ">Life</h4>
        <p id="tribute-info " class="para "> Little is known about Sappho's life for certain. She was from the island of Lesbos and was probably born around 630 BCE. Tradition names her mother as Cleïs,though scholars may simply have guessed this name, assuming that Sappho's daughter Cleïs
            was named after her. Sappho's father's name is less certain. Ten names are for Sappho 's father from the ancient testimonia; this proliferation of possible names suggests that he was not explicitly named in any of Sappho's poetry.The earliest
            and most commonly attested name for Sappho 's father is Scamandronymus. In Ovid's Heroides, Sappho 's father died when she was seven.Sappho's father is not mentioned in any of her surviving works, but Campbell suggests that this detail may
            have been based on a now-lost poem. Sappho 's own name is found in numerous variant spellings, even in her own Aeolian dialect; the form that appears in her own extant poetry is Psappho</p>

        <p id="tribute-info" class="para ">Sappho probably wrote around 10,000 lines of poetry; today, only about 650 survive. She is best known for her lyric poetry, written to be accompanied by music. The Suda also attributes to Sappho epigrams, elegiacs, and iambics; three of these
            epigrams are extant, but are in fact later Hellenistic poems inspired by Sappho, as are the iambic and elegiac poems attributed to her in the Suda.Ancient authors claim that Sappho primarily wrote love poetry, and the indirect transmission
            of Sappho's work supports this notion. However, the papyrus tradition suggests that this may not have been the case: a series of papyri published in 20 contains fragments of ten consecutive poems from Book I of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho,
            of which only two are certainly love poems, while at least three and possibly four are primarily concerned with family.</p>
